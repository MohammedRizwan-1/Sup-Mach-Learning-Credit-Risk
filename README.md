# Sup-Mach-Learning-Credit-Risk-classification
# **Introduction**

The purpose of this challenge was to build a prediction model that would be able to analyze credit worthiness of borrowers for a bank and flag potential loan defaults. The dataset provided by the bank contained 77,536 entries with seven key indicators. These are listed as follows:

* Size of the loan
* Interest rate on the loan
* Borrower's income 
* Debt_to_Income ratio
* The number of of accounts that the borrower uses regularly
* Derogatory marks on the borrower's credit report
* The borrower's total debt

A final column called *loan status* was provided that indicated a healthy loan with a `0` and a loan in default with a `1`.

# **Comments and Thoughts**

I found this assignment to be straight-forward and much easier for me than previous analysis. Most of my time was spent on the report and README, and getting all the details right. I am feeling more and more confident with my python, data analysis and pandas abilities with every challenge. I played around with the data a little just to add some details of interest. Simple things, but I think they added to the overall report. For instance, I got the total loans outstanding from the dataset, and figured out the percentage of those loans that were in default. I thought this information was crucial in convincing the bank of the importance of getting an accurate model. When you have 46 million dollars in loans that could go into default, you definitely want to put some resources into it.

Enjoyed this  a lot, and learned quite a bit.
